Transcription:

> This is simply when you let a cut fly with a fling against your opponent's head.

> > For example, position yourself in the guard of the Fool and pull your sword back through by your right side; just as you pull your sword back, step with your right foot toward your opponent and sling your cut at their head.

> > This Slinging Cut shall fly just as a stone is thrown from a sling. Whatever else is necessary concerning slinging you will find written later in the section on devices.
