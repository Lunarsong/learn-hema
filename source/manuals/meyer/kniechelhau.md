> This is so called from the body part to which it is directed. Do it thus: After the initial Onset, when you have come under your opponentâ€™s sword with your hands up above your head, and he holds his head thus between his arms, then cut with Thwart Cuts under his pommel up toward his wrist-bones or wrist-joints. If he holds his hands too high, then cut with these Thwart Cuts up from below toward the knob of his elbows; thus it is done.
