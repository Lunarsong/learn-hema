In Meyer's system the High Cut (or Over Cut) is a vertical strike from above and is mentioned to also be the Scalp Cut (Scheitelhau), which is one of Liechtenauer's master cuts.

> *"The High Cut is a straight cut directly from above, against your opponentâ€™s head toward their scalp, therefore it is also called the Scalp Cut."*

It is worth to note that within the Liechtenauer system the {{ page.title }} appears to include all cuts with a downward angle, be it straight down or diagonal.

In Meyer's system there is a divergence with the {{ page.title }} being a vertical cut while the [Wrath Cut / Zornhau](zornhau) refers to diagonal cuts from above.
