Zettel from [Wiktenauer](http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Johannes_Liechtenauer):

#### This is the Prologue
> 1	Young knight, learn\\
>  to love god and revere women;\\
> 2	thus your honor will grow.\\
>  Practice knighthood and learn\\
> 3	the Art that dignifies you,\\
>  and brings you honor in wars.\\
> 4	Be a good grappler in wrestling;\\
>  lance, spear, sword, and messer\\
> 5	handle manfully,\\
>  and foil them in your opponent's hands.\\
> 6	Strike in and hasten forth;\\
>  rush to, let it hit, or go by.\\
> 7	Thus those with wisdom, the ones who\\
>  are revered, will envy him.\\
> 8	This you should grasp:\\
>  All arts have length and measure.


#### This is a general teaching of the long sword
> 9	If you want to behold the art,\\
>  See that you go on the left and strike with the right.\\
> 10	And left to right,\\
>  is how you strongly want to fight.\\
> 11	He who follows the strokes,\\
>  should rejoice little in his art.\\
> 12	Strike close whatever you will,\\
>  no Changer will come into your shield.\\
> 13	To the head, to the body\\
>  do not shun the Tag-Hits.\\
> 14	Fight with the entire body,\\
>  What you powerfully want to do.\\
> 15	Listen to what is wrong,\\
>  do not fight above on the left if you are righthanded;\\
> 16	and if you are lefthanded,\\
>  on the right you limp as well.\\
> 17	Before and After, these two things,\\
>  are to all skill a well-spring.\\
> 18	Weak and Strong,\\
>  Always remember the word Instantly.\\
> 19	So you may learn\\
>  To work and defend with skill.\\
> 20	If you are easily intimidated,\\
>  no fencing should you learn.\\
> 21	Learn five strokes\\
>  from the right side against the opposition.\\
> 22	Then we promise\\
>  that your arts will be rewarded.

>  views in a righteous way,\\
> 106	And each one of\\
>  those same winds I consider to be triple\\
> 107	So they are\\
>  twenty-four.\\
> 108	And count them only, from both sides.\\
>  Eight windings learn with stepping.\\
> 109	And test the bind\\
>  no more than soft or hard.
