The Middle or Traversing Strike can execute most effects the Wrathful Strike can, the difference is only that while the Wrathful Strike is a forceful high point, the Diagonal Traverse is brought full on. How the upper lines are traversed is shown in both illustration C (background) and illustration G (background). Such lines are also applicable to Dusack.
